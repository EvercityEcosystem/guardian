### Introduction 

The AR-AM0014 methodology is designed to facilitate the restoration of degraded mangrove habitats through afforestation and reforestation activities. This approach enables the use of both mangrove and non-mangrove species, with specific guidelines to ensure environmental sustainability. If more than 10 percent of the project area is planted with non-mangrove species, any alteration of the hydrology within the project area is strictly prohibited. The methodology also limits soil disturbance to no more than 10 percent to preserve the habitat's integrity. Project activities may choose to account for or exclude carbon pools such as dead wood and soil organic carbon but must exclude the litter carbon pool.

### Need and use for AR-AM0014 Policy

Mangrove ecosystems are critical for coastal protection, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, many mangrove habitats are degraded due to human activities such as deforestation, land conversion, and pollution. The degradation of these vital ecosystems results in significant carbon emissions, loss of biodiversity, and reduced coastal resilience.

The AR-AM0014 methodology addresses the urgent need for effective restoration of degraded mangrove habitats through afforestation and reforestation efforts. This methodology is specifically tailored to restore the ecological function and carbon sequestration capacity of these unique wetland environments. By facilitating the re-establishment of both mangrove and non-mangrove species, AR-AM0014 ensures the recovery of degraded lands while adhering to strict environmental standards to prevent further harm, such as limiting soil disturbance and prohibiting hydrological changes when non-mangrove species exceed 10 percent of the planted area.

Projects using this methodology can choose to include or exclude specific carbon pools such as dead wood and soil organic carbon, although the litter carbon pool must be excluded. This flexibility allows project developers to tailor their activities to the specific conditions and needs of their project sites while ensuring comprehensive carbon accounting.

Although Verra has published the VM0033 Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration, it has provided a pathway for projects already listed on the Verra Registry before August 31, 2022, to continue using the AR-AM0014 methodology, provided they completed validation and requested registration by February 28, 2023. 

### Policy workflow

![AR-AM0014]()

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent creating the project on the Evercity Platform. After they create the Project Idea Note (PIN) using the Evercity PIN Builder, they proceed to identify relevant project partners using the Evercity Service Providers Listing. Together with the selected partner, they create the Project Design Document (PDD). The PDD includes project details, and ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters. Once provided the necessary information, the Guardian automatically calculates the project’s baselines, as well as project’s net GHG emissions reductions and removals. The Registry then adds the project to the pipeline on the Guardian. Next, the Project Proponent assigns the VVB that can be found on the Evercity Service Providers Listing, to validate the PDD and provide the Validation Statement on the TrustChain. Once the project has been validated by the VVB, the Project Proponent can issue the Guardian-native carbon forwards in order to raise upfront finance. 

### Available roles 

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the ARR project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VM0047 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities. Upon successful validation, the project proponent receives Carbon Forwards (CF), representing the carbon credits with a delayed delivery.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VM0047 guidelines.

3. **Registry (Verra)** - Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports.

### Token

Carbon Forwards (CF) are prepaid carbon credit purchase agreements between the Carbon Forward Buyer and the Project Proponent. As per the Carbon Forward Agreement the Project Proponent commits to deliver the carbon credits at a given time in the future to the Forward Buyer. Carbon Forwards are providing critical early-stage funding necessary for the Project Owner to cover the carbon consulting and implementation costs.
On the other hand, the Carbon Forwards enable the Buyers to benefit from the price upside, by securing high-quality carbon credits at the most favorable prices. They can sell Forwards at any time and receive yield from web3-enabled liquidity pools while holding them. 
Once the emission reductions have been verified by a Validation/Verification Body (VVB), the Standard issues carbon credits to the project owner who then delivers the credits to the forward holder.
