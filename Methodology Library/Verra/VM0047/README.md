### Introduction 

The Verra’s VM0047 methodology not only quantifies the carbon removal potential of afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) projects, but it also takes into account the emissions resulting from the burning of biomass and the use of nitrogen fertilizer. This comprehensive approach ensures that the net GHG emissions reduction resulting from the project is accurately quantified, verified, and credited. The methodology establishes guidelines for project design, implementation, and monitoring to assess the project's impact on local biodiversity and social and economic conditions, as well as address potential risks. The methodology promotes sustainable land use practices that contribute to mitigating climate change, support the conservation of biodiversity, and incentivize the adoption of more sustainable land use practices. The ARR methodology is a newly developed set of guidelines and procedures by Verra for quantifying and verifying greenhouse gas emissions reductions resulting from afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects.

### Need and use for VM0047 Policy

The urgent need to restore degraded lands and sequester carbon effectively has brought the importance of afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) to the forefront. Unmanaged deforestation and land degradation contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exacerbating climate change. Addressing these issues requires systematic and scientifically-backed methodologies to ensure effective carbon sequestration and land restoration.

The VM0047 methodology from Verra provides a detailed framework for implementing ARR projects, offering a structured approach to enhancing carbon stocks and restoring ecosystems. VM0047 outlines specific procedures for quantifying carbon sequestration in afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects. This includes detailed methodologies for measuring carbon stocks in various biomass components and ensuring that the projects meet rigorous environmental and social standards.

**Changes in Verra Standards**
Non-Permanence Risk Buffer: There is an increase in the non-permanence risk buffer, which is crucial for accounting for potential future climate impacts. Projects may need to consider factors such as fire and climate forecasts when calculating this buffer. 

Permanence Monitoring: The new standard now requires a minimum permanence monitoring period of 40 years for projects following methodology VM0047.

**Changes in Methodology**
ER Calculation Approaches: Projects can use either a census-based approach or an area-based approach to calculate carbon credits.

Area-Based Approach Selection: Projects have the option to choose the area-based approach under certain conditions:
The project should produce continuous tree and/or shrub cover on any contiguous area exceeding one hectare.
The project may include both direct activities (e.g., manual planting, broadcast seeding) and indirect activities (e.g., activities that permit or facilitate natural regeneration).

**Additionality Steps for Area-Based Approach:**
Step 1: Regulatory Surplus: Projects need to prove regulatory surplus as per the latest VCS Methodology Requirements, ensuring that their emission reductions go beyond business-as-usual conditions.
Step 2: Performance Benchmark: A performance benchmark should be established, and projects will demonstrate additionality if certain parameters significantly differ from the benchmark.
Step 3: Investment Barrier: For additionality assessment, projects can conduct either a benchmark analysis or an investment comparison analysis as required by the VCS Methodology Requirements.

These updates are significant for projects following VM0047, and they will need to ensure compliance and thorough documentation of these elements moving forward.

### Policy workflow

![VM0047]()

The workflow begins with the Project Proponent creating the project on the Evercity Platform. After they create the Project Idea Note (PIN) using the Evercity PIN Builder, they proceed to identify relevant project partners using the Evercity Service Providers Listing. Together with the selected partner, they create the Project Design Document (PDD). The PDD includes project details, and ex-ante estimates of the monitoring parameters to demonstrate alignment with the VCS. Once provided the necessary information, the Guardian automatically calculates the project’s baselines, as well as project’s net GHG emissions reductions and removals. The Registry then adds the project to the pipeline on the Guardian. Next, the Project Proponent assigns the VVB that can be found on the Evercity Service Providers Listing, to validate the PDD and provide the Validation Statement on the TrustChain. Once the project has been validated by the VVB, the Project Proponent can issue the Guardian-native carbon forwards in order to raise upfront finance.

### Available roles 

1. **Project Proponent** - The project proponent is responsible for initiating and executing the ARR project. They must follow the requirements outlined in the VM0047 methodology and provide evidence of the project activities. Upon successful validation, the project proponent receives Carbon Forwards (CF), representing the carbon credits with a delayed delivery.

2. **Validation and Verification Body (VVB)** - The VVB plays a crucial role in independently validating and verifying the project data submitted by the project proponent. They thoroughly assess the project design document, including the baseline scenario, additionality demonstration, and estimated emission reductions. Additionally, the VVB verifies the monitoring reports and evaluates the project's adherence to the VM0047 guidelines.

3. **Registry (Verra)** - Verra serves as the registry, responsible for project intake, pipeline management, and final review of project design documents and monitoring reports.

### Token

Carbon Forwards (CF) are prepaid carbon credit purchase agreements between the Carbon Forward Buyer and the Project Proponent. As per the Carbon Forward Agreement the Project Proponent commits to deliver the carbon credits at a given time in the future to the Forward Buyer. Carbon Forwards are providing critical early-stage funding necessary for the Project Owner to cover the carbon consulting and implementation costs.
On the other hand, the Carbon Forwards enable the Buyers to benefit from the price upside, by securing high-quality carbon credits at the most favorable prices. They can sell Forwards at any time and receive yield from web3-enabled liquidity pools while holding them. 
Once the emission reductions have been verified by a Validation/Verification Body (VVB), the Standard issues carbon credits to the project owner who then delivers the credits to the forward holder.
